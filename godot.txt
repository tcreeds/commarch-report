A. Game Engine, focused on providing developers with the tools they need to make games, no strings attached.

B. Last commit was October 5th (today). 1.0 was released in December of 2014, having been an in-house engine previous to that.

C. There are many direct committers, but there is one developer who handles the majority of pull requests. 

D. There are 249 total contributors, and itâ€™s hard to tell if everyone has commit access. There are about as many direct commits as pull requests merged into master.

E. Unique knowledge

F. The coefficient of fail is 60. Again, it could probably be more accurate, as I didn't investigate every item as thoroughly as I could have, but I think it's accurate enough for our purposes.

G. Most of the top contributors are very regular, but more than half seem to have started contributing in the past year or so. One of the top developers stopped contributing about a year ago.

H. The BDFL is Juan Linietsky. He started the project, and is currently the top contributor, with 60 commits to the repo in September.

I. Most people on the project seem to touch different parts, with the different types of work being fairly distributed among developers.

J. What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

K. How is the project's participation trending and why?

L. In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

M. In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

N. Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

O. Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?

P. If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

Q. Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

R. Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
