L. In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

M. In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

R. Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
